# BLAF Project

This project is based on a excel file wich I'm working for a few years; every year this file is growing with new additions or modificactions in the data entry area and in the results area, also in the visual presentation design.

According to what is written in the previous paragraph; the file is bigger and bigger with each modification so I decided to change the file type from an excel file to a system base on the web.

I'm going to use HTML, CSS, JS, PHP or Python and MySQL or MS SQL Server in this system.

For me, this is an **ambitious project** because is goint to be the first project after I complete my Web Developer traning program.
